# foldingtext-plugins
This repo has plugins to add functionality to the [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com/) editor for Mac. 

## Installation instructions

These plugins can be [installed](http://support.foldingtext.com/t/how-to-install-a-plugin/74) like any other plugin, by copying the .ftplugin directories to the FoldingText plugins folder.

## Plugin functionality

### remap-home-end-keys.ftplugin

Since FoldingText has its own key binding system, it does not obey OS X system key binding overrides. This plugin makes the Home and End keys move the cursor (or selection) to the Start and End of a line, respectively.

### spaces-not-tabs.ftplugin

Insert four spaces rather than a tab, honor selections and Shift-Tab to de-indent.
