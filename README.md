# foldingtext-plugins
Plugins to add functionality to the FoldingText editor for Mac

## remap-home-end-keys.ftplugin

Since FoldingText has its own key binding system, it does not obey OS X system key binding overrides. This plugin makes the Home and End keys move the cursor (or selection) to the Start and End of a line, respectively.

## spaces-not-tabs.ftplugin

Insert four spaces rather than a tab, honor selections and Shift-Tab to de-indent.
